# 863TheoryGen

This was a theory generator for the 863 youtube series by using a list that I created based on my knowledge of Project 863 to create a little fun generator to give little fun theories for the lore.

How to run: When the page loads the program should automatically run!

Future changes: add a section to add your own theory parts and push them to the arrays and when the page is reloaded and those theory parts should pop up as well!
